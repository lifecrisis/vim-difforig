1. Introduction

                                                              *difforig-intro*
One of the first custom commands that many Vim users encounter is the
|:DiffOrig| command.  The minimal effort required to develop a working
implementation of this feature is striking, but the basic version of the
command leaves much to be desired.  This plugin was created to provide
a more pleasant interface to this useful feature.

                                                       *difforig-improvements*
This script improves upon the classic |:DiffOrig| command in the following
ways:

  * The diff view is opened in a new tab so that the current workspace is
    left completely undisturbed.
  * Syntax highlighting is disabled so that the only visible highlighting is
    that applied by the diff feature itself.
  * The diff buffers are not modifiable so that multiple diff views can be
    opened while remaining fully unrelated.  Each diff tab can be thought of
    as an isolated snapshot capturing the current status of your change.
  * The diff tab can be opened quickly with "<Leader>o" and closed quickly
    with the "q" mapping.
  * Side-effects of the operation are minimal as diff buffers are not listed
    and user errors are managed gracefully.

2. Features

                                                            *difforig-command*
A. The New ":DiffOrig" Command

:DiffOrig
    This command opens a new diff tab for the active buffer.  If changes to
    the buffer do not exist or if the file cannot be read, the operation
    will gracefully fail with a warning message.

                                                           *difforig-mappings*
B. Default Mappings

<Leader>o  or  <Plug>(DiffOrig)
    This mapping simply invokes the new ":DiffOrig" command in the context
    of the active buffer.

q
    When viewing a diff tab, this key will quickly close the tab.  A message
    reminds you that this operation is available whenever you open a new
    diff tab.

                                                      *difforig-customization*
C. Customization

g:DiffOrigSetTabName()
    This global function can be overridden by the user to set the name for
    a diff tab.  It is called whenever a new diff tab is opened.  The
    default implementation for this function takes no action.
